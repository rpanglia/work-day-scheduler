# Work Day Scheduler 
This project consists of a calendar application that allows it's user to view the current date and time, enter information by the hour and be able to save their inputs into this handy scheduler! This application runs in browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, powered by jQuery. Starter code was provided for this assignment. Starter code features moment.js. Page is responsive. 

## Description 
When this application is loaded, user arrives on the Work Day Scheduler landing page. The current date and time appears on the screen. There are 9 rows in which the user can input information, matching the standard business hours (9am-5pm).
User can click on any row to begin typing contents directly into this field. Rows are colour-coded indicating if that time block is in the past (grey), present (red) or future (green). Once content with their input, user can save this data by clicking the blue button to the right (with the white save icon). Client is able to refresh this page, and their data is saved as it is on their local storage.
